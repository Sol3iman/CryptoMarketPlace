I used the truffle suite unbox template to build a crypto token market place. You can interact with
the smart contract on a testnet like ganache or ropsten. Just make sure you change the config-truffle.js file if you want to jump on ropsten. You need to install lite-server if you want to run 
the frontend on your local server.
